**Redesign a Website Homepage for Better Usability**

**Redesign – Design Brief**

--> *Research & Understanding:*
I started by exploring LinkedIn’s current dashboard to understand its structure and features. The main areas included the header (navigation bar), sidebar, news section, and content feed.
I noticed that while LinkedIn’s interface is professional, it can sometimes feel crowded and visually heavy. I wanted to make it look cleaner, more balanced, and modern while keeping the same professional tone.

--> *Design Goals:*
Maintain LinkedIn’s brand identity like blue, white, and grey tones with simple, readable fonts.
Improve readability and user focus on important elements like profile, posts, and news.
Make the layout more spacious and balanced for easier navigation.
Ensure all elements are accessible and user-friendly.

--> *Design Decisions:*
-> Header
I kept the LinkedIn logo, search bar, and menu icons similar to the original for familiarity.
Increased spacing between icons to make the top bar cleaner and less cluttered.
Added hover-ready icons (Home, My Network, Jobs, Messaging, Notifications, Me) for better interactivity.
-> Sidebar
Added simple icons and clear labels for quick access to My Network, Jobs, Messaging, Groups, Events, and Hashtags.
Used a card layout to separate the sidebar visually from the feed.
Included “Recent” and “Followed Hashtags” sections for personalization.
-> Main Content
Added a Profile Summary card showing the user’s picture, name, and headline.
Included a Profile Completion Bar to motivate users to update their profile.
Designed a Create Post Section with buttons for media, events, and articles.
Used card-style Activity Feed posts with clear spacing, bold user names, and visible reaction buttons (Like, Comment, Repost, Share).
-> Right Panel (LinkedIn News)
Designed a compact, minimalistic news list with small icons and clickable links.
Used subtle dividers to separate news items for readability.

--> *Visual & UX Improvements:*
Used consistent spacing and soft shadows to create depth without clutter.
Chose rounded corners to give a modern, friendly appearance.
Increased white space to make the dashboard feel open and less congested.
Followed LinkedIn’s blue palette for brand consistency.
Prioritized accessibility with clear contrast and large click areas.
Designed in Figma, using auto layout and components for consistency.
Added small annotations in Figma explaining my reasoning for layout and spacing choices.

--> *Outcome:*
The final design maintains LinkedIn’s professional identity but looks cleaner, modern, and more user-friendly.
 It enhances usability by making important sections more visible.
